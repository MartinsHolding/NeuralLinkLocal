## ⚡ Technical Core

* **In-Browser Inference:** Powered by **Transformers.js**, executing pre-trained neural weights directly via the browser's hardware acceleration.
* **Privacy-First Architecture:** 100% of the data processing happens in the user's RAM. No data ever leaves the machine.
* **WASM Optimized:** Leverages WebAssembly for near-native execution speeds during tensor computations.
* **Modern ES6+ Implementation:** Uses clean, modular JavaScript with asynchronous pipelines for a non-blocking UI.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Transformers.js (Xenova)
* **Runtime:** WebAssembly (WASM) & JavaScript ES6
* **UI:** Cyber-Terminal CSS (Monospace HUD)
